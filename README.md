Chrome extension to replace online form labels with funny texts

Steps to run:

- download repo
- load unpacked extension in chrome
- click extension icon on page with forms

ToDo:

- [x] replace automatically without clicking extension button
- [ ] remember user's preferred pages (stored as cache?)
- [ ] get user input for funny phrases
- [ ] allow selective labels to be replaced (show users a list of labels and make them choose maybe...)
